The '''4SP Organization''' is the official administrative and development body behind the [[4simpleproblems]] (4SP) project. It was established to bring better structure, organization, and professionalism to the development of the toolkit, which had grown from a simple joke page into a complex software platform.

The Organization's primary website serves as the hub for project history, documentation, and the distribution of the "Local" version of the software.

== Purpose ==
The Organization was created to solve the "clutter" issues of early versions (specifically Version 2) and to provide a dedicated home for:
* '''Project History:''' Documenting the rapid evolution of the tool.
* '''Distribution:''' Hosting the ''Downloadable Version (V5 DV)''.
* '''Standardization:''' Ensuring consistent design ("Geist" font, dark aesthetic) across all 4SP tools.

== Timeline ==
The Organization tracks the major epochs of the 4SP project:

{| class="wikitable"
! Date !! Version !! Codename !! Description
|-
| March 13, 2025 || '''Version 1''' || Genesis || A simple soundboard. External hosting.
|-
| April 11, 2025 || '''Version 2''' || Great Expansion || Added 36 pages and multimedia. Became disorganized.
|-
| May 15, 2025 || '''Version 3''' || Visual Redesign || Shifted to a light theme and "Outfit" font.
|-

|-
| December 2, 2025 || '''Version 5''' || The Rebuild || Complete code rewrite for security.
|-
| December 16, 2025 || '''Version 5 DV''' || Downloadable Version || The final form of V5. Local, unblockable, and secure.
|}

== Downloadable Version (V5 DV) ==
One of the Organization's key releases is '''Version 5 DV'''. This version allows users to download the site structure to their local device.
* '''Goal:''' To bypass network blocks that target specific URLs.
* '''Requirement:''' Despite being "local," the software maintains dependencies on online services (like Firebase) and '''requires an internet connection''' to operate. It is not a fully offline "air-gapped" application.

== Tech Stack ==
The Organization utilizes modern web standards for its infrastructure:
* '''Core:''' HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
* '''Styling:''' Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and custom CSS variables for the dark theme.
* '''Services:''' Firebase for backend infrastructure (Auth, Database).
